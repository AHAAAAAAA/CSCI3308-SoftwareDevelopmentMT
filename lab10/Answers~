Snippet1:
l16: indescriptive class name
l19: hardcoded path
l20: runs everything in a directory?!?
l21,23,25: indescriptive function names
Just every variable name sucks.
l28: shitty syntax, no idea what it does.
l35-40: if statements should be a single conditional consisting of if's and elifs.
l43: get rid of the pointless comments young woman.
l45: uh. bad?
l54: bad again like 45

0/10 maintainability, 0/10 scalability, 1/10 robustness (out of pity).


Snippet2:
Better variables good job!
l22: Security disaster.
l29: I don't understand this, I don't like this.
l30: I don't understand this, I don't like this.
l32: Comment what l32 checks.
l33: reads whatever you give the program. Security booboo.
l38: Why are you confused about your own code?
l40-46: if statements should be a single conditional consisting of if's and elifs.
l49: Can you subtract time like that? Is that the avg?
l51: Move the round command out of the print.
l52: unnecessary comments.

Snippet3:
better
l21: You hardcoded your user path?!?
l22: not pretty.
l35: breakdown
l36: breakdown
l47-52: if statements should be a single conditional consisting of if's and elifs.
l59: move the round function out of this
l63-64: combine the 2 lines.
